# workload-prediction
This is a project to look at machine learning methods to predict the future workload of a service based on simulated data.  

It will include a program to create simulated data for provided time intervals.  The intervals should be cretated so they are unique from future times you want to predict.  I will be using Year, Month, Day, Hour, Weekday initially and trend the workload on the weekday to avoid smply matching the date from a previous year.

There will also be progam(s) for building machine learning models through different methods to compare the results of the different methods.

The Scikit-Learn library is used for the machine learning models.
